 * `pglite://<path>` -> PGlite, which is PostgreSQL itself compiled to WASM and
 *                      run in-process with a file-backed data directory.
 *
 * PGlite is the default so the harness runs end-to-end with no external
 * infrastructure. It is real PostgreSQL - the same SQL, the same migrations,
 * the same jsonb/bigserial/index semantics - not a shim or an emulation, which
 * is why the migration files are shared verbatim between both drivers.
 *
 * A certification platform whose own test suite runs against a mocked
 * repository would be asserting correctness it never demonstrated, so every
 * test in this project opens a real in-process PostgreSQL instance instead.
